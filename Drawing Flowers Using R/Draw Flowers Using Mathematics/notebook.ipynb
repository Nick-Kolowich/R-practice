    "<p>Plants arrange their leaves in spirals. A spiral is a curve which starts from the origin and <em>moves away</em> from the origin as it revolves around it. In the plot above all our points are the same distance from the origin. A simple way to arrange them in a spiral is to multiply <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> by a factor which increases for each point. We <em>could</em> use <code>t</code> as that factor, as it meets these conditions, but we will do something more <em>harmonious</em>. We will use the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_angle\">Golden Angle</a>:</p>\n",

Imagine that you have a circumference and you break up it into two arcs with lengths <code>a</code> and <code>b</code>, with <code>a&gt;b</code> (an arc is a portion of the circumference). The angle that <em>breaks</em> the circle so that <code>a/b=(a+b)/a</code> is called the Golden Angle. In other words: the Golden Angle <em>breaks up</em> a circle so that the ratio of the big arc to the little arc is the Golden Ratio. This image (from Wikipedia) illustrates the previous definition:</p>\n",
